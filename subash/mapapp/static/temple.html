    Sri Ottadi Periyasamy Temple is situated at the foot of Kolli Hills, 5 km from Muthukapatti near Namakkal. Devotees say that the 300-year-old temple swami himself appeared as swayambu and blessed the devotees and the huge banyan tree there is a testimony to this.
    According to the temple's histories, the snake fell on the body of the devotee who paid obeisance at the temple and told him in a dream that an idol should be built separately for him. That's why on the left side of the entrance of the temple, the idol of Nagammal is placed in a row and a large nada idol is placed.
    
    At a distance from the temple are Karuppusamy and Muneeswarar, who sits majestically on a horse in the middle of the temple, grace the devotees. It is the belief of the devotees that the place of Ottadi Periyasamy, who is seated as the guardian deity, has a career, prosperity and if the mind melts and prays for the desired things to happen, everything will come to fruition.
    
    It is the belief of the devotees that those who are not blessed with children, those who want to get rid of witchcraft and witchcraft, can get rid of it by writing it down and tying it to vels and spears. This is the reason why devotees have placed spears, spears and beads around the temple.
