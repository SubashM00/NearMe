    This school is situated in a spectacular location in the northern part of Namakkal district. This is an ideal place for living out the ethos of allowing children to be children. There is no rush to grow up here, but the foundations are laid for nurturing the resilience of our children to achieve high standards through unrivalled activity programs and around the clock personal care. In addition to more than 20 sports, pupils have immediate access to numerous outdoor and indoor pursuits, by this process, we incubate a sense of success and achievement in every one of our children. With the 21stCentury learning environment, our grade 2 students will work confidently with iPads and the older children have access to outstanding Digital Interactive Classrooms, Modernized Computer, Science & Math's Laboratories, with teachers who are no strangers to programming, explosions, dissections & calculations.
